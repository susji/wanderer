# wanderer

We simplement a simple control software for a device called Wanderer. It was
also known by its Finnish translation Kulkuri. The device is a battery-operated
and portable sensor device manufactured around 1991 by Elektrobit/Extrabit. The
only unit I've seen measures ambient temperature and vibration as a function of
time. The device came with a disk containing a control program meant for Windows
2 and 3. The interesting parts of the original software are reimplemented here.

So far I've only gotten the device to work with Windows 10 and using a
motherboard provided RS232 serial port. No luck with a few different USB-RS232
adapters on Windows or Linux...
